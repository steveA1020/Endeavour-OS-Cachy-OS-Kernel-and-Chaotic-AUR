First Let's setup the Caotic AUR:

Run theses 2 commands together:

sudo pacman-key --recv-key 3056513887B78AEB --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 3056513887B78AEB

Then these 2 together:

sudo pacman -U 'https://cdn-mirror.chaotic.cx/chaotic-aur/chaotic-keyring.pkg.tar.zst'
sudo pacman -U 'https://cdn-mirror.chaotic.cx/chaotic-aur/chaotic-mirrorlist.pkg.tar.zst'

Now let's install Cachy OS repository:

Run these commands together:

curl -O https://mirror.cachyos.org/cachyos-repo.tar.xz
tar xvf cachyos-repo.tar.xz && cd cachyos-repo

# Run the automated installer

sudo ./cachyos-repo.sh

It's going to ask you if you want to install, say yes, and it's probably going to ask you if you want to upgrade firmware, say yes, but then when it asks you to do a full system upgrade, say no

Then open file manager and navigate to /etc/pacman.conf and open it with your text editor

scroll down until you see 4 cachy os entries cut them out and repaste them at the end of the file making sure you leave one space in between each entry and then under the Cachy os entries add the chaotic aur entry

[chaotic-aur]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/chaotic-mirrorlist

Then open terminal and run:

sudo pacman -Syu

Now you can install Cachy OS kernel-manager and the Cachy OS settings just remember when it ask you to select between packages select the Cachy OS one.

yay -S cachyos-kernel-manager

yay -S cachyos-settings

Now open kernel-manager and install whatever kernel you want and don't forget to update your grub with 

sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

or install this package to make it easier

yay -S update-grub

then you can do this command to update your grub:

sudo update-grub 

Then Reboot and select new kernel in advance option in grub

To remove old kernel just do this command:

sudo pacman -Rc linux linux-headers

If you have Lts kernel to remove do this command:

sudo pacman -Rc linux-lts linux-lts-headers

Then update your grub:

sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
or
sudo update-grub
